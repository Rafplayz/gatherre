welcome to the thingy i've been working on for about like a month now

compile steps:
- step 1. 
install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)<br>
open command prompt and paste `npm i -g typescript`<br>
- step 2. clone repository<br>
- step 3. run `tsc` from command prompt in your local folder<br>
- step 4. if you see an "install types" error go ahead and install them. atm the types used include:
`npm i @types/jquery`
compiled javascript will go into the `compiled-js` directory. then you can just host the index.html file on your server or just open it directly.

now panic as you view my spaghetti code that combines jquery and typescript AND well that's it BUT it still is stupid
